### Contributing Translations

Language contributions are welcome! To add support for a new language:

1. Copy the `en.js` file in the localization directory
2. Rename it with the new language locale code (e.g., `es.js` for Spanish, `de.js` for German, `jp.js` for Japanese)
3. Translate the text inside the file, keeping the key structure intact
4. Import your new language file in index.js and add it to the locales object:

   ```javascript
   import es from './es'; --> // Import the new language file

   const locales = {
       en: { translation: en },
       fr: { translation: fr },
       es: { translation: es }, --> // Add the new language to locales
   }
   ```

5. Add the language to the `languages` array in LocalizationContext.js:
   ```javascript
   const [languages] = useState([
       { tag: 'en', name: 'English' },
       { tag: 'fr', name: "Fran√ßais" },
       { tag: 'es', name: "Espa√±ol" } -->  // Add the new language
   ])
   ```
